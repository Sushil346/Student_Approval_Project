readme_content = """# Admission Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project implements **logistic regression from scratch** to predict student admission based on given features.

## Steps
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Reads `adm_data.csv` & `adm_test_data.csv`.  
   - Creates `Admit_Status` column (1 = Admitted, 0 = Not Admitted).  
   - Scales features using `StandardScaler()`.  

2. **Logistic Regression Implementation**  
   - **Sigmoid Function** for probability calculation.  
   - **Cost Function** (Binary Cross-Entropy).  
   - **Gradient Descent** for weight optimization.  
   - **Prediction Function** with thresholding.  

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Runs for **100,000 iterations** with `Î± = 0.0005`.  
   - Computes training accuracy.  

4. **Visualization**  
   - **Cost vs Iterations** plot for convergence analysis.  

## How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
python admission_prediction.py

# Future Improvements

This section outlines future improvements for the project:

## Add L2 Regularization
- Implement **L2 Regularization** to enhance the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.

## Experiment with SVM or Neural Networks
- Explore using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with different kernels.
- Experiment with **Neural Networks (NN)** to further improve the model's performance and accuracy.
